# outreach-migration-schema

This repository contains definition files for the CSV files used to import Outreach content into Streem | CisionOne.

The definitions are stored as `YAML` files. 

Updates to the schema will be managed via a PR process where sign-off is required by multiple parties to commit the updates to the main repository.
